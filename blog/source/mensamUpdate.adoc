= Update: Mensam

After more than 1 year of features and maintenance and I felt the need to write up a summary of the state of this desk booking application.
Visit https://felixspringer.xyz/homepage/blog/mensamAnnouncement[this blog article] if you want to take a look at the initial announcement.

=== Stability

I checked my server logs and had an uptime of `99.98986%`.
The server was only down for software updates, but a few times I had some minor issues with the Nix cache and the server ran out of memory, which required manual intervention.

To improve this I should use a Docker container instead of NixOS to deploy it.

=== Self-hosting

There is a Docker image now that anyone can host themselves.
The database is selfcontained, but make sure to configure email (optional) and a reverse proxy for HTTPS.

=== Frontend

At my first announcement the frontend was still pretty rough around the edges.
By now it should be a lot better with proper touch support and generally a lot of nice UI features.

=== Backend

There were no major changes, just some additional HTTP routes and new database columns mostly.

=== Database

Using automated database migrations works wonderfully. No complaints about SQLite.

== Features

I honestly don't want to list everything here, but here are some of the more noticable features.

* UI Dashboard.
* Smooth experience when joining new spaces (using URL or QR-Code).
* Drag pointer on timetable to select reservation time.
* Room overview.
* Email notifications.
