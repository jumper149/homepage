|===

== Preparation

Cut onion in half and then each half into semi rings.
Cut garlic into small pieces or use a garlic press.

Rinse off the beans using water.

Put butter and the onion rings into a coated cooking pot and apply medium heat with the stove.
Now add cumin and turmeric.
The onion rings will become yellow.
Wait 2 minutes.

Turn down the stove a little and add the garlic.
Wait 30 seconds.

Throw the beans into the pot.
Also add the 150ml of water.
Keep the water bubbling slightly.
Stirr everything every once in a while.
You can use a lid to keep water inside or let it evaporate, however you like it.
Keep this going for 6 minutes.

Now also add some salt and pepper.
Also add lemon juice and pulp.
Add dill.

Put the baguette into the oven.

Now throw in the tomatoes and stirr everything one last time.
Dig a few holes into the beans into which you then crack the eggs.
Now you definetely want to add the lid and wait until the eggs are cooked.
Try to keep the eggs a little bit soft, which you can check with a fork.

Serve the beans and take the baguette out of the oven.
