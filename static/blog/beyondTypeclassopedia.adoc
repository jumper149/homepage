== beyond Typeclassopedia

There are quite a few type classes, that are completely fine the way they are defined in the https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base[base] library.
These are mostly part of the famous https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia[Typeclassopedia].

* `Semigroup` and `Monoid`
* `Functor`, `Applicative` and `Monad`
* `Foldable` and `Traversable`

=== Typeclassopedia

The https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia[Typeclassopedia] also explains `Pointed` and `Comonad`.

`Pointed` is a superclass of `Applicative` with just `pure`.
I am not against this separation, but can't think of an example of `Pointed`, that isn't also `Applicative`.

TODO: `MonadFix`

CAUTION: I am only covering the "`left`" side of the https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia[Typeclassopedia].
The `Category` and `Arrow` type classes are not discussed here.
I am also ignoring `Comonad` for now.

To conclude the https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia[Typeclassopedia], let's look at `Alternative`.

==== `Alternative`

NOTE: `MonadPlus m` is equivalent to `(Alternative m, Monad m)`.
It's an unnecessary alias, but it doesn't do any harm.

`Alternative` can actually be expressed with the other already introduced type classes.

CAUTION: The `QuantifiedConstraints` language extension is required.

[source,haskell]
----
class (Applicative f, forall x. Monoid (f x)) => Alternative f where

  empty :: f a
  empty = mempty

  (<|>) :: f a -> f a -> f a
  (<|>) = (<>)
----

NOTE: The `Applicative f` superclass is not necessary at all, but otherwise it would be an alias for `forall x. Monoid (f x)`.

The only problem is, that https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base[base] introduces some `Monoid` instances, that don't work with this definition.
`Maybe` for example uses a superclass constraint.

[source,haskell]
----
class Semigroup a => Monoid (Maybe a) where
  -- ...
----

The proposed `Alternative` doesn't work, because `forall a. Semigroup a` (from `Maybe`) is a stronger constraint than `forall x.` (from `Alternative`).

[TIP]
====
The solution would be to use compatible instances.
The currently used instances can still be made available with ``newtype``s.

The `newtype` `Alt` already exists for the other direction `Alternative f => Monoid (f x)`.
====

The current situation isn't bad though, considering that ``newtype``s are annoying to use.
Maybe https://www.idris-lang.org/[idris] made the right choice with named implementations (multiple named instances in Haskell terms).

Another interesting change would be the separation of `(<|>)` and `empty`, similar to the separation of `Semigroup` and `Monoid` (or `Pointed` and `Applicative`).

[TIP]
====
The structure of `Applicative` and `Alternative` is similar to a semiring.
[cols="1,1,1,1"]

| `Applicative` / `Alternative` | natural numbers | boolean algebra | algebra of types

The https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia[Typeclassopedia] is actually quite old by now and there are more additions in https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base[base].

=== `base` library

Let's start with `MonadFail`.
This type class was a stupid idea to allow pattern matching in __do-__notation.
Whenever writing actual code you should use a __case-__block.
Patterns that _always_ match are fine, but other patterns should just give a warning like "`patterns are non-exhaustive`".

`Bifunctor`, `Bifoldable` and `Bitraversable` are nice to have.
Generalizations for `Trifunctor`, `Quadrofunctor`, etc. are missing though.
I'm not sure how those type classes would be implemented without boilerplate.

`MonadIO` is a type class for all monads, that use `IO` as the base monad.
This is a useful type class, but it can be completely replaced with `MonadBase` from https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-base[transformers-base].
Additionaly `MonadBaseControl` from https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monad-control[monad-control] could be added to https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base[base].

NOTE: I am in favor of completely removing `MonadIO`, which some people might find a bit harsh.

`MonadTrans` from https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers[transformers] and `MonadTransControl` from https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monad-control[monad-control] also fit into the same category, but for monad transformers.

https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base[Base] introduces `Contravariant` functors, which can be derived from https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia[Typeclassopedia]s `Comonad`.
Analogously to `Applicative` and `Alternative`, the https://hackage.haskell.org/package/contravariant[contravariant] library defines `Divisible` und `Decidable`.
These two type class can be quite useful, but I haven't explored in this direction any further.

NOTE: This didn't cover _all_ type classes from https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base[base], but only the ones similar to the https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia[Typeclassopedia].

=== Takeaways

* Classes like `Monoid` will often have multiple lawful instances, but Haskell requires us to use a `newtype` for each implementation.
Instances should be chosen wisely.
* `Alternative` and `Applicative` can be thought of as monoids.
* `MonadFail` is a _fail_.
* `MonadBase` makes `MonadIO` unnecessary.
* `MonadBaseControl` and `MonadTransControl` would be a nice addition to https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base[base], including `MonadTrans` and `MonadBase`.
